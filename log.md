### Day 04 : June 16
**Today's Progress** : Worked on following the flexbox articles. Tomorrow will start implementing the concepts.

### Missed 14 & 15 June. 
### Day 03 : June 13
**Today's Progress** : Read up on the git slideshow. Understood the basic, essential commands. Those seems to be suffice for now. If needed will go into deeper later. Started the wesbos flexbox course, near completion stage.

**Thoughts** : Regarding flexbox, it seems to make lot of layout quite easy to make. But there are quite a few new concpets to wrap head around. Will practice implementing them. Starting Sass from tomorrow also. Eager to implement them in portfolio V2.

### Day 01 : June 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chrome devtools course.

**Thoughts**: Will learn devtools little later, after getting some javascript. then it will make more sense. Tomorrow will do the Git course and then dive straight into flexbox. Excited to learn flexbox, it will help with lots of layout problems.
