Been using Livestyle for LiveReloading CSS, but with SASS, that wasn't working so, added BrowserSync. There had been some hiccup while setting up. Looked up on web , at the end done it.

 ### Day 11 : June 25: Sunday
**Todays's Progress** : :metal: Completed the SASS course at treehouse. Lots of things to understand. Will practice by implementing them for better understanding.
