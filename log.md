 ### Day 19 : July 9, Sunday
 
**Todays's Progress** : FInished and published the portfolio project late last night. Today started Wordpress course on Treehouse.com . Gone over the basics, setup XAMPP for local development.

**Thoughts** : Taking a slight diversion from front end path. Want to learn Wordpress. It has a great demand in Freelancing. Also, it's easy to create a website in it quick depending on use case. Neccesary Skills. After doing with Wordpress, will start Javascript.

**Thing(s) learned**:
* Setting database and user for wordpress
* Categories and Tags
 
 ### Day 18 : July 8, Saturday
 
**Todays's Progress** : Coded for 1 hour. The portfolio-two project is nearly finished (98%). Worked on desktop view today.

**Link to work** : [Portfolio Project](https://shovanch.com/portfolio-two/)

**Thoughts** : Its looking good enough. Experimented with colors with this project. Stayed with gray as primary color and shades  of it. Used single font family to simplify the design process. Overall its a good experience. One thing need to work on, making the coding habit at a consistent time early in the day, rather than till the late night. So far, so good. Will write a medium article on monday about journey so far of first 20 days. 

 ### Day 17 : July 7, Friday
 **Todays's Progress** : Coded for 1 hour. Today worked on the portfolio-two site. the mobile view is nearly ready. Working on the clip path for the slanted effect. Got the CS50 certificate. Great achievemnet. That was an really life changing course. Building up the basics of CS.

**Thoughts** : Horrible week this has been. Lots of missed. Probably the problem is I'm focusing too much on the project. THe optimal approach would be to just focus on sit and code for 1 hour daily. That's it. Its the better way.

 ### July 6 : Missed.
 
 ### Day 16 : July 5, Wednesday
 **Todays's Progress** : Missed two days in between. This had not been a week I wanted, but we all had our obstacles. I am back. Worked on the portfolio-two project. Hoping to finish this project by tomorrow. 

**Thoughts** : Up and down and up and down.. its time to make some upppppps.. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### July 3 & 4 : Missed.
 
 ### Day 15 : July 2, Sunday
 
**Todays's Progress** : Started the portfolio-two project. Worked on the HTML markup.

**Thoughts** : There had been some obstacles in the way. Mentally. But, the journey must go on and on and on. Obstacle is the way.

### July 1 : Missed. :disappointed:
### June 30 : Another one. Resistance  is coming back strong again. Fight off!! :punch: . Lets start the new month and second half of 2017 on a positive note.
### June 29 : Had an off day. 
### Day 14 : June 28, Wednesday
**Todays's Progress** : Made the boilerplate for projects. It would make starting projects very easy. As it would bypass stage  of starting from scratch and setting  everything - "A recipe of procrastination"

**Thoughts** : Had been using a boilerplate for projects. But that was for only HTML, CSS. This time added gulp tasks for SASS, BrowserSync, Autoprefix, Sourcemaps. Been using Livestyle for LiveReloading CSS, but with SASS, that wasn't working so, added BrowserSync. There had been some hiccup while setting up. Looked up on web , at the end done it. Its time to work on projects.

 ### Day 13 : June 27, Tuesday
**Todays's Progress** : Designed the desktop view of the portfolio site. Will work on mobile view tomorrow and start coding it.

**Thoughts** : This project will acts summation of all the learnings - HTML, CSS, SASS, Flexbox, so far. After this, will work through Wordpress a bit, just enough to make it work. And then finally, the JAVASCRIPT. This project does have some challenges like making those mac's reponsive, the slanted divs. Good for learning. Will write the medium article next week. On completion of third week of #100daysofcode and from there on write weekly. Exciting learning journey.

### Day 12 : June 26, Monday
**Todays's Progress** : Light work today. Watched some Sass related videos on treehouse. Will start designing and coding the portfolio site tomorrow.

**Thoughts** : There are lots of nitty-gritty details in Sass. But rather than only learning, its better to learn the basics and code and learn as needed along the way. So, thats the approach I'm gonna take. Will write a medium article tomorrow on First week experience of #100daysofcode.

 ### Day 11 : June 25: Sunday
**Todays's Progress** : :metal: Completed the SASS course at treehouse. Lots of things to understand. Will practice by implementing them for better understanding.

**Thoughts** : Sass makes CSS acts like a programming language, with things like functions, variables, loops. While it takes some time to understand the big picture. It is a essential skill. Will use SASS on projects now on. Probably learn some gulp and use gulp as task runner. 

**Thing(s) learned**:
* Using partials for modular code
* Making custom functions and color functions
* Using mixin with null and keyword arguments - useful for flexbox syntaxes
* Adding conditional logic using @if
* Looping with @for to output columns
* Storing values in maps 

 ### Day 10 : June 24, Saturday
**Today's Progress** : 1 hour. Started SASS course on Treehouse. Learned about variables, mixin, include ...

**Thoughts** : SASS seems like fresh breath. Adds some programming logic to CSS. Better code experience. Tomorrow, will finish the SASS course. Then, putting newly learnt flexbox and sass into by making new portfolio site

**Thing(s) learned**:
* Variables in Sass
* Nested selector and ampersand for parent reference.
* Using mixin and @include for reusable code blocks
* @extend and placeholder selectors. Be careful of unneccesary selector expansion.
 
 ### June 23 : Missed. Internet was down :thumbsdown:
 
 ### Day 09 : June 22, Thursday
**Today's Progress** : 1.5 hours. Coded the flexbox app layout following the guide.

 ### Day 08 : June 21, Wednesday
**Today's Progress** : 30 minutes. Completed the exercises at flexbox froggy. Setup sublime text for SCSS.

**Today's Progress** : Read up on the git slideshow. Understood the basic, essential commands. Those seems to be suffice for now. If needed will go into deeper later. Started the wesbos flexbox course, near completion stage.

**Thoughts** : Regarding flexbox, it seems to make lot of layout quite easy to make. But there are quite a few new concpets to wrap head around. Will practice implementing them. Starting Sass from tomorrow also. Eager to implement them in portfolio V2.

### Day 02 : June 12
**Today's Progress** : Worked on the git course. Learned the commands. The concepts of Git are coming along nicely. Will use git from command line from now on, it seems more efficient. 

**Thoughts** : Tomorrow will give a deeper look into git workflow. Then, moving on to learn flexbox. Exciting times!

### Day 01 : June 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chrome devtools course.

**Thoughts**: Will learn devtools little later, after getting some javascript. then it will make more sense. Tomorrow will do the Git course and then dive straight into flexbox. Excited to learn flexbox, it will help with lots of layout problems.
